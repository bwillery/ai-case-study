The additional funding allowed them to create the following products. UNET Waitlist which adds you to the national wait list and monitors your health data.  UNET DonorNet monitors data for the organ donor. UNET Transnet is used ensure the safe packing, labeling and transportation of a donated organ. 

* UNOS uses or partners with Twillo, AMBRA, Angular, Tableau, ALAMOFIRE, Swift, Apple, Nutanix, Azure, QTS, Salesforce, ServiceNow, SQL Server, .NET Apigee and B. They've used the partnerships to create the following. Waitlist that contains transplant candidate data, DonorNet which stores donor data, Transnet safegaurds the organ transport, Data Services provides insights for improvements and TIEDI houses the pre/post-transplant data.

## Landscape

* UNOS is in the medical field.

* The bloodless kidney and liver transplantation was a significant breakthrough. This provided options for people who don't believe in blood transfusion, or it might be against their religion.

The healthier the recipient, the more likely that the transplant will be successful and the patient will live a longer and healthier life. 

* The added nutritional coach could compile data in Azure ML, tableau, excel, IBM Watson, SAP Analytics, SAS or any dashboard based software.

* Each of the technologies previously mentioned are able to assist with predictive analytics. The outcomes could be used to create nutritional coach for patients with similar health issues and statistics.
